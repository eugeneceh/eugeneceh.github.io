## About Me

A coder by passion.

I am a fan of open source and dabbled in Palm OS, Memplug, HTML and once thought the Palm OS was the best mobile operating system until the arrival of iOS.  

These days, I dabble in R and Python in the little spare time I have and have taken a huge interest in machine learning, Raspberry Pi, GPUs, modding and Tidyverse.
